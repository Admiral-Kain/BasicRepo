# BasicRepo
Some basic repo that I created. This is a test.

Essentially this is what most people's first program would be like. Simply commanding the console to output "Hello, World!". The following files contain how to write such a program in the C++ and Java programming languages. Of course to actually run this, you would need an Integrated Learning Environment (otherwise known as an IDE). My preferred IDE for C as well as C++ is Microsoft Visual Studio and for Java as well as Python are IntelliJ and PyCharm, both from JetBrains. If you're on a Linux distro, I would recommend either Code::Blocks for C/C++ development as there is no official Visual Studio version available for Linux. Of course, there are other IDEs out there such as XCode available for MacOs as well as Eclipse which is another popular IDE most programmers use.

The following links redirect you to the official sites to download said IDEs that I normally use and have installed on my PC. The one that I recommend downloading for most users are the community versions, as no payment are required for those.
